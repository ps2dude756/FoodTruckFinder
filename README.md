Project
=======

I chose the project Food Trucks because it seemed both interesting and 
practical, and would cause me to learn some interesting new frameworks.

Technical Track
===============
I chose the Back-end track because I have very little experience with 
front-end technologies such as JavaScript.

Technical Choices
=================

Back-end
--------
I chose Python as the back-end language because it is my preferred language 
and the language most of Uber's back-end is written in. I then decided to use
Flask for the web framework because some of my colleagues have recommended it
in the past, and I have read that since it is smaller and more minimalistic,
it works better for creating REST apis than a larger framework such as Django.
While I have used Python in the past, I had never used Flask before, nor had I
done any web coding in Python. Because of this, one of my early tasks for this
project was to read large sections of the documentation on the Flask website,
detailed in Issue #1.

Front-end
---------

Hosting
-------
I chose to use Heroku to host the project, because I had heard using Heroku was
very simple and straight-foward. Additionally, Heroku has an article detailing
deploying up a Flask app on their site. I had never used Heroku before this 
project.
